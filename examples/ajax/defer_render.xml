When working with large data sources performance is often of primary importance. For this reason DataTables will only create the table `-tag tr` and `-tag td` cells when they are drawn on the page. This feature is called _deferred rendering_ and is enabled automatically since DataTables 2.

It is rare that you'll want to disable this feature, but if you do need to do so (for example you need to guarantee that all nodes are available for form submission or similar) this option can be set to `false` as shown in this example.

You won't notice any performance difference with just the standard DataTables data set, but for tens of thousands of rows it can make a significant difference and we recommend keeping it enabled.
