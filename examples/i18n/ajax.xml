<info><![CDATA[

As well as being able to pass language information to DataTables through the `-init language` initialisation option, you can also store the language information in a file, which DataTables can load by Ajax using the `-init language.url` option.

The following example shows DataTables reading a German language file which is hosted on the [DataTables CDN](https://cdn.datatables.net). We have a [wide range of translations provided by the community](https://datatables.net/plug-ins/i18n/) for you to use and additional contributions are very welcome.
