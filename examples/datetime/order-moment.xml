<title>Ordering formatted dates (Moment.js)</title>

<info><![CDATA[

You might wish to tell DataTables about a specific date/time format that your data contains, but either you don't wish to transform it into a different format, or you aren't sure which columns the date/time data will be in (i.e. can't use the `datetime` rendering function). For such cases, we provide a `DataTable.datetime()` function to which you provide a format string. This will instruct DataTables to look for and parse data in such a format. 

As with DataTable's other date and time methods, `DataTable.datetime()` supports both [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) and [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/). In this example we are using Moment.js. For a full range of its formatting options, please see the [Moment.js documentation](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/). Note that the parsing is strict - your assigned format must exactly match the data.
