When you want to have user selectable rows in DataTables, it is relatively trivial when using DOM based data - but when using server-side processing, DataTables doesn't retain DOM row elements over pages / filtering etc. As such, you will need to keep a track of which rows a user as selected and mark them as selected on each draw.

This is shown in this demo, which uses a unique ID assigned to the TR element (this is done automatically through the use of the `DT_RowId` special property returned as part of the object given by the server for each row) to track which rows are selected and reselect them is appropriate on a draw.
