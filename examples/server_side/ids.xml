<info><![CDATA[

Often when using server-side processing you will find that it can be useful to have a specific ID on each row (the primary key value from the database for example). By assigning the ID you want to apply to each row using the property `DT_RowId` of the data source object for each row, DataTables will automatically add it for you.

In addition to `DT_RowId` there are two other properties which perform similar actions: `DT_RowClass` and `DT_RowData`:

* {string} `DT_RowId` - Add an ID to the _TR_ element
* {string} `DT_RowClass` - Add a class name to the _TR_ element
* {object} `DT_RowData` - Add HTML5 _data-_ attributes to the _TR_ element. This is an object of key / value pairs which are assigned as data attributes to the _TR_ element.

This example below shows `DT_RowId` being used to add information to the table. In addition objects are used as the data source for the rows.
