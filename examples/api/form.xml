In order to perform paging, ordering, searching etc, DataTables can remove rows and cells from the document (i.e. those rows / cells which are not needed are not inserted into the document). This increases performance and compatibility, however, it means that submitting forms which span multiple pages requires a little bit of additional work to get the information that is not in the document any longer.

The `dt-api $()` method can be used to get nodes from the document regardless of paging, ordering etc. This example shows `dt-api $()` being used to get all `tag input` elements from the table. In the example a simple `alert()` is used to show the information from the form, but an Ajax call to the server with the form data could easily be performed.

If you are interested in a complete CRUD editing suit for DataTables have a look at the [Editor extension](//editor.datatables.net) which provides simple setup and complete integration with DataTables.
