DataTables has the ability to integrate seamlessly with almost any styling library, and integration files are provided for several of the popular styling libraries, including [jQuery UI](//jqueryui.com).

To have your table styles integrate with jQuery UI's ThemeRoller styles, simply include the DataTables CSS and JS integration files for jQuery UI, as shown in this example. Note also that because jQuery doesn't provide table styles like some other CSS frameworks, the CSS integration file does add this styling information.
