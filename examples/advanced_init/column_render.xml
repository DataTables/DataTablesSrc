Each column has an optional rendering control called `dt-init columns.render` which can be used to process the content of each cell before the data is used. `dt-init columns.render` has a wide array of options available to it for rendering different types of data orthogonally (ordering, searching, display etc), but it can be used very simply to manipulate the content of a cell, as shown here.

This example shows the person's age combined with their name in the first column, hiding the age column. This technique can be useful for adding links, assigning colours based on content rules and any other form of text manipulation you require.
