Often you may want to have your table resize dynamically with the page. DataTables does this automatically! As you resize the window, which in turn resizes the width that the table has available to fit in, it will automatically resize to fit.

If you wish to constrain the table further, you can do so by controlling the width of the container it is in. In this example the container is set to be 80% of its own container's width. Note that it will still dynamically resize as the container's own width changes.
