	<description>
		This option is used to set the text content (i.e. `textContent` in DOM API terms) for the `-tag div` that is created by the `-feature div` feature. This option and `-feature div.html` are complimentary, but not to be used together. They both set the content of the `-tag div`, but in this case any HTML in the string will be escaped making it safe for uncontrolled user input. Use `-feature div.html` if you want to create HTML elements.
