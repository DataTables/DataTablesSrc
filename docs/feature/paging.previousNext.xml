		The paging control for DataTables will show _Previous_ and _Next_ buttons in the paging control along with the other buttons - e.g. by default it looks like:

		> First Previous 1 ... 5 **6** 7 ... 23 Next Last

		In some cases you might wish to disable the previous and next buttons, which can be done with this feature. If done, the resulting layout for the paging buttons would be:

		> First 1 ... 5 **6** 7 ... 23 Last

		This option can be combined with `-feature paging.firstLast` and `-feature paging.numbers` to provide complete control over the buttons that are shown in the paging control.
		
		Please note that if `-feature paging.type` or `-init pagingType` are set, this option will have no effect.
