		Defaults to the `-init lengthMenu` option's value.

	<description>
		This parameter allows you to readily specify the entries in the length drop down `select` list that DataTables shows when pagination is enabled. It is an array of options - each option can either be:

		* An integer which will be used for both the displayed option and the value to use for the display length, or
		* An object which contains `label` and `value` properties. This can be useful for language strings such as `All`.

		The page length values must always be integer values greater than 0, with the sole exception of `-1`. When `-1` is used as a value this tells DataTables to disable pagination (i.e. display all rows).

		Note that the `dt-init pageLength` property will be automatically set to the first value given in this array, unless `dt-init pageLength` is also provided.

		This option will default to the value given by `-init lengthMenu`, which should generally be preferred over this option as the language strings can be loaded by Ajax and shared for the whole table, but if needed, this option is available to override that.
