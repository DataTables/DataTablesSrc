	<description>
		When a user performs a search operation on the table, this string is appended to the info feature's display text to given an indication of what the search means in the context of the number of rows found.

		This option will default to the value given by `-init language.infoFiltered`, which should generally be preferred over this option as the language strings can be loaded by Ajax and shared for the whole table, but if needed, this option is available to override that.
