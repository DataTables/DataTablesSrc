		DataTables built in pagination control has the ability to show a variable amount of page number buttons. The default is 7, but you might want to show less depending on your layout. The number given should always be **odd**.

		Please note that DataTables pagination control is responsive. It will automatically remove number buttons until the control fits onto a single line, as required by the page's layout.
