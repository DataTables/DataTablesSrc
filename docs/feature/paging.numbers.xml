		The paging control for DataTables will show a set of numbers for pages in the table, allowing the end user to quickly jump between specific pages - e.g.:

		> First Previous 1 ... 5 **6** 7 ... 23 Next Last

		In some cases you might wish to disable the number display, which can be done with this feature -e.g. the resulting layout for the paging buttons would be:

		> First Previous Next Last

		This option can be combined with `-feature paging.firstLast` and `-feature paging.previousNext` to provide complete control over the buttons that are shown in the paging control.
		
		Please note that if `-feature paging.type` or `-init pagingType` are set, this option will have no effect.
