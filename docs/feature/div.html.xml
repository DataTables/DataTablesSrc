		This option is used to set the HTML content (i.e. `innerHTML` in DOM API terms) for the `-tag div` that is created by the `-feature div` feature. This option and `-feature div.text` are complimentary, but not to be used together. They both set the content of the `-tag div`, but in this case any HTML in the string will be __not_ be escaped making it unsafe for uncontrolled user input. Use `-feature div.text` if you want plain strings. However, this option is useful for controlled input - i.e. a string you set yourself.
