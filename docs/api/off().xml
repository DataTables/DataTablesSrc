		</parameter>
		<parameter type="function" name="callback" default="">
			Specific callback function to remove if you want to unbind a single event listener. If not given, all events which match the event name / namespace given in the first parameter will be removed.

	<description>
		DataTables can trigger a number of events which can be useful for taking action when DataTables performs those events. For example, it is often useful to know when an Ajax event occurs (`dt-event xhr`), so you can add additional data to the JSON payload.

		DataTables provides three methods for working with DataTables events, matching the core jQuery event methods:

		* `dt-api on()` - Listen for events
		* `dt-api off()` - Stop listening for events
		* `dt-api one()` - Listen for a single event.

		This `dt-api off()` method is used to remove a listener that has already been attached to a DataTable. Simply pass in the event you wish to remove the listener for, and optionally the specific function if you want to remove only a single event listener.

	<example title="Listen for only the first `dt-event xhr` event from DataTables"><![CDATA[
var table = $('#example').DataTable( {
	ajax: "/data",
	serverSide: true
} );

table.on( 'xhr', function ( e, settings, json ) {
	table.off( 'xhr' );
	console.log( 'Ajax event occurred. Returned data: ', json );
} );

// note that this is the same effect as using `table.one(...);`
