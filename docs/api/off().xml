	<description>
		DataTables can trigger a number of events which can be useful for taking action when DataTables performs those events. For example, it is often useful to know when an Ajax event occurs (`-event xhr`), so you can add additional data to the JSON payload.

		DataTables provides three methods for working with DataTables events:

		* `-api on()` - Listen for events
		* `-api off()` - Stop listening for events
		* `-api one()` - Listen for a single event.

		This `-api off()` method is used to remove a listener that has already been attached to a DataTable. Simply pass in the event you wish to remove the listener for, and optionally the specific function if you want to remove only a single event listener.

		Backwards compatibility note: if jQuery is loaded on your page, or registered with DataTables (`-api DataTable.use()`), DataTables will use jQuery for event handling. As of DataTables 3, if jQuery is not available, it will use its own event handling.

	<example title="Listen for only the first `-event xhr` event from DataTables"><![CDATA[
var table = new DataTable('#myTable', {
	ajax: '/data',
	serverSide: true
});

table.on('xhr', function (e, settings, json) {
	table.off('xhr');
	console.log('Ajax event occurred. Returned data: ', json);
});

// note that this is the same effect as using `table.one(...);`
