	<description>
		This method provides the ability to destroy a DataTables saved state which can be useful during development, or potentially when logging a user out if you want to clear the saved state before the state expires (`-init stateDuration`).

		This method will trigger a DataTables state save but with an empty object (i.e. `{}`), effectively erasing any existing state data.

		Note that if DataTables saves state after this method is called, the state will be stored again (a draw is the most common method of triggering a state save).
