	<description>
		DataTables caches data for searching and ordering in order for those operations to run as quickly as possible when they are required. Sometimes it can be useful to get the data that DataTables has cached for these operations, for example when creating a `select` list to provide a column based filter.

		Cached data is not guaranteed to be available at any particular moment. If DataTables hasn't requested the data, it won't have been cached. This is particularly obvious when using the `-string order` option and a sort hasn't been performed on a column. Invalidation of data will also cause the cache to be removed.

		Please note that the order of the data in the returned array and which rows the data is obtained from (searched rows, visible rows etc) is controlled by the `-type selector-modifier` option of the `-api column()` selector used to get the selected column.

		Additionally, if the selector used in `-api column()` matches more than one column, the result set will be truncated to a single column - the first one in the result set.
