	<description>
		Select an individual column to work with from a DataTable, with its chained methods providing the ability to get work with the column, taking actions such as toggling its visibility or obtaining the data from the column.

		Note that this method selects a single column. If the selector provided resolves to multiple columns, the result will be truncated to just a single column - the first one found. If you need to work with multiple columns, the `dt-api columns()` method is available with the same selection options.
