		If can sometimes be useful to know how many items are contained in an API's result set - a function that is provided by this method.

		It is important to note that the `length` property cannot simply be reliably used itself to determine if the API result set contains any elements or not as the DataTables API is multi-table aware and the result set consists of nested arrays. Therefore we must flatten arrays before being able to use the `length` property. This method does exactly that (i.e. it is a shortcut for `api.flatten().length`).
