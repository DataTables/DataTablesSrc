		When searching in DataTables we provide the ability to search for words which have accented characters without typing the accent. For example searching for `Desiree` would match _Désirée_.

		This method exposes that ability for external use as well as the ability to replace the diacritic removal method that DataTables uses.

		Our default method uses [the `normalize` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize) in JavaScript with a `NFD` normalisation form. The way this works is to decompose the accented character into a base ASCII character plus its accent as a second character. We then remove the accent characters.

		If you wish to disable the diacritic normalisation that DataTables uses, you can do so by giving this method a function that simply returns the original input, e.g.:

		```js
		DataTable.util.diacritics(d => d);
		```

		Using the example from before, this would mean than when searching for `Desiree` would _not_ match __Désirée_.
