		It is often useful to know what data is available in a result set, with duplicate items removed (for example creating a `dt-tag select` list for use as a search input). Although unique items can be found quite trivially with a loop, this utility function provides that ability for you in one simple method.

		This method makes use of the fact that DataTables API objects are "array like", in that they inherit a lot of the abilities and methods of the JavaScript `Array` type.
