	<description>
		This option defines the number of elements that are stored in an API instance's result set.

		This property makes use of the fact that DataTables API objects are "array like", in that they inherit a lot of the abilities and methods of the JavaScript `Array` type.

		In this case, this property is basically the same as the `Array.length` property. For more information about the original property, please refer to the [Mozilla MDN documentation for `length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length).

var table = new DataTable('#myTable');

alert('Number of row entries: ' + table.column(0).data().length);
