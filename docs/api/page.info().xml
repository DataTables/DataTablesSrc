	<description>
		The paging state of the table can often be useful to understand what data is being displayed in a table at any given time - indeed it can even be useful when `dt-init paging` is disabled to get information about the number of records in the table.

		This method provides information about the table's paging state, and information about the number of records in the table (both total and in the search result set).

		The returned object has the following properties:

		* `page` - Current page index (zero based - i.e. the first page is `0`)
		* `pages` - Total number of pages
		* `start` - Display index for the first record shown on the current page
		* `end` - Display index for the last record shown on the current page
		* `length` - Display length (number of records). Note that generally `start
		  + length = end`, but this is not always true, for example if there are
		  only 2 records to show on the final page, with a length of 10.
		* `recordsTotal` - Full data set length
		* `recordsDisplay` - Data set length once the current search criteria has been applied.
		* `serverSide` - A boolean value that indicates if the table is operating in server-side processing mode or not (`dt-init serverSide`). This can be useful when working with paging and the API as index results can be offset by the display start point.

		Example returned object:

		```js
		{
			"page": 1,
			"pages": 6,
			"start": 10,
			"end": 20,
			"length": 10,
			"recordsTotal": 57,
			"recordsDisplay": 57,
			"serverSide": false
		}
		```
