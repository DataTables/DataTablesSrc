			Specify which cache the data should be read from. Can take one of two values: `dt-string search` or `dt-string order`. Defaults to `order` if no value is given.

	<description>
		DataTables caches data for searching and ordering in order for those operations to run as quickly as possible when they are required. Sometimes it can be useful to get the data that DataTables has cached for these operations, access to which is provided by this method.

		Cached data is not guaranteed to be available at any particular moment. If DataTables hasn't requested the data, it won't have been cached. This is particularly obvious when using the `-string order` option and a sort hasn't been performed on a column. Invalidation of data will also cause the cache to be removed.
