		You may find it useful to know if an API instance's result set contains a particular value. While that can be achieved readily with `-api indexOf()`, this utility method can be a useful short-cut if you don't need to know the value's location in the result set.

		This method makes use of the fact that DataTables API objects are "array like", in that they inherit a lot of the abilities and methods of the JavaScript `Array` type.

var table = new DataTable('#myTable');

var found = table
	.column(0, { page: 'current' })
	.data()
	.includes(21);

if (found) {
	alert('21 was not found in the result set');
}
else {
	alert('21 was found at index: ' + index);
}
