	<description>
		The "state" of a DataTable refers to properties that define its current display, such as pagination parameters, ordering and filtering. While you can use individual API methods to get and set properties (e.g. `-api order()`) this method provides a collected API that will give and take information about the table as a whole. Please note also that it __does__ work without `-init stateSave` being enabled.

		The data object has the following format, but please be aware that plug-ins and extensions to DataTables can modify this structure by adding data as they require for their own state information.
		
		```js
		{
			"time":   {number}               // Time stamp of when the object was created
			"start":  {number}               // Display start point
			"length": {number}               // Page length
			"order":  {array}                // 2D array of column ordering information (see `order` option)
			"search": {
				"search":          {string}  // Search term
				"regex":           {boolean} // Indicate if the search term should be treated as regex or not
				"smart":           {boolean} // Flag to enable DataTables smart search
				"caseInsensitive": {boolean} // Case insensitive flag
			},
			"columns" [
				{
					"visible": {boolean}     // Column visibility
					"search":  {}            // Object containing column search information. Same structure as `search` above
				}
			]
		}
		```
		
		If using this method as a setter, you will very likely want to call `-api draw()`, passing in `false` to the method, to ensure that the table is redrawn with the new state (and that the correct paging is shown).
