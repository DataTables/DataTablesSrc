	<description>
		This method will reduce a 2D array structure to a simple 1D structure, which can be particularly useful when working with the plural methods such as `dt-api rows()` and `dt-api columns()` which can return 2D structures data (for example in the columns data, each column has its own array of information).

		This method makes use of the fact that DataTables API objects are "array like", in that they inherit a lot of the abilities and methods of the JavaScript `Array` type.
