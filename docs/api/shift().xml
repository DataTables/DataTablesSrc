		Just as with Javascript arrays', since the DataTables API object is "array like", items can be removed from a result set using this method. *Shifting* a result, shifts the item off the start of the result set. The API instance's result set is reduced in length by 1 and the item that was removed is returned from the function call. `dt-api pop()` can be used to perform the same action, but at the end of the array, if required.

		This method is a proxy for the Javascript `Array.prototype.shift` method and is provided as a utility method for the DataTables API. For more information about the original method, please refer to the [Mozilla MDN documentation for `shift`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift).
