	<description>
		This method is used to get the nodes of for the row `dt-tag tr` nodes in the rows matched by the selector.

		Please note that the order of the nodes in the returned array and which rows the nodes are obtained from (searched rows, visible rows etc) is controlled by the `dt-type selector-modifier` option of the `dt-api rows()` selector used to get the selected rows.

		Furthermore, please be aware that using `dt-init deferRender` will cause some nodes to be created only when they are required for display, so they might not be immediately available when this method is called.
