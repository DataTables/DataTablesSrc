A `jQuery` instance is an instance of the [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/Types/#jQuery) object. Although, technically, this is an object primitive, is it useful to define this type to indicate where a jQuery instance is expected / returned.

A `jQuery` instance is created from the `jQuery` (often aliased to `$`) constructor - for example `$('#example')`. The jQuery object provides a number of methods for operating on the DOM elements in the document.

A full description of the `jQuery` type is available in the [jQuery documentation](https://api.jquery.com/Types/#jQuery).


## Use in DataTables

As of DataTables 3, jQuery is not required to run (while in previous versions it was a hard dependency), DataTables 3 still supports the use of jQuery for backwards compatibility.

Where a parameter is shown as accepting a jQuery type, or a method returning a jQuery type, it indicates that a jQuery value is accepted / returned. It should be noted as well that if a method accepts an array of nodes, a jQuery object could be given, since it is _array-like_.
