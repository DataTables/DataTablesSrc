The DataTables data type object contains information about how it should handle different data types.

Using [Typescript definitions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/type-declarations.html), the object has the following structure:

```js
interface DataTable.Type {
	className?: string;
	detect: (data: any) => string;
	order: {
		pre?: (data: any) => any;
		asc?: (a: any, b: any) => number;
		desc?: (a: any, b: any) => number;
	};
	search?: (data: any) => string;
}
```

## Properties

### className

The class name property is used to automatically assign a class to columns matching this data type. That might be used for stylistic changes or typography. For example the built in `num` data type uses `dt-right` as the class name to align numeric data to the right.

### detect

This is the function that is used to detect a data type. The function should check the data that is passed in to determine if it matches the data type expected and if so it will return a string with the name of the data type (this **must** match the data type name!). If the data doesn't match the expected format return `null`. Almost any data type can be passed into this function, so care must be taken - you can't just assume that it will be a string.

As an example, consider the following to detect IPv4 addresses:

```js
function (data) {
	return typeof data === 'string' && data.match(/^((25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d)\.?\b){4}$/))
		? 'ipv4'
		: null;
}
```

### order

Ordering in DataTables is done by the `pre`, `asc` and `desc` functions defined for a type:

* `pre` - Pre-deformatting method. Used to convert the formatted data into orderable data
* `asc` - Ascending ordering method
* `desc` - Descending ordering method

Each of these functions is optional and you may use one of the following combinations:

* `pre` only - ordering will be done using the DataTables default sort on the returned data.
* `asc` and `desc` only - [standard Javascript sorting functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort).
* All three - the preformatted data will be passed into the custom ordering methods.

It is strongly recommended that you provide a `pre` method if you need to transform the data from the original data type into something that the ordering methods will use. This is because the `pre` function is run only once per data point while ordering, while the `asc` and `desc` ordering methods might be called multiple times per data point.

As an example, consider the following ordering data type definition which is used to sort data without a `the` prefix (common used for books and films). Here we only need to use a `pre` deformatter (which is the case with most ordering definitions):

```js
function (data) {
	return data.replace(/^ the/i, '');
}
```

### search

The search function is used to transform the input data into the string that will matched against when DataTables performs any searching for the end user. In this way it is very similar to the `pre` ordering deformatter in that is pre-processes the data.

This is done as can be useful to strip out data that should not be searched, e.g. HTML tags, or it can be used to provide redundancy in search terms for example the user might search for a displayed telephone number with spaces or without. The following example demonstrates that:

```js
function (data) {
	// Return original data and also remove any non-numeric data, so
	// '555-2368' would be returned as '555-2368 5552368' allowing
	// either form to be searched for
	return data + ' ' + data.replace(/[^\d]/g, '');
}
```
