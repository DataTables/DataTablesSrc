The DataTables `-api cells()` and `-api cell()` methods provide the ability to select individual cells from the table. What cells are selected and how the selector actually operates is controlled by this `-type cell-selector` data type.

### Options

The cell selector can be given in a number of different forms, to make it easy to apply to your data and use case:

* No selector - Select all cells
* `-type string` - CSS selector
* `-type node` - This may be one of the following:
  * `-tag td` / `-tag th` cell
  * Any element which has both a `data-dt-row` and `data-dt-column` attribute assigned to it, or a parent (<span class="since">Since: 1.10.11</span>). This can be used by extensions such as FixedColumns and Responsive to allow easy column selection.
* `-type function` - Function selector (<span class="since">Since: 1.10.3</span>)
* `-type object` - DataTables cell indexes (`row` and `column` properties)
* `-type jQuery` - jQuery object of cell nodes
* `-type array` - Array containing any combination of the above options


## No selector

If no selector is given (more specifically `-type undefined`), then all cells are selected.

###### Get the nodes for all cells in the table:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let cells = table.cells().nodes();
```


## string

When the selector is given as a string, it is treated as a [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Selectors) that operates on the `dt-tag td` and `dt-tag th` elements in the table's `dt-tag tbody`.

Note that just like a CSS selector, is it possible to supply multiple selectors using comma separated notation (i.e. just separate by a comma) when the selector is provided as a string.

###### Get data from a single cell by id:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let data = table.cell('#cell-2-42').data();
```

###### Select cells by class name:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let cells = table.cells('.priority');
```

###### Select cells by two class name selectors:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let cells = table.cells('.important, .intermediate');
```


## node

`dt-tag td` and `dt-tag th` DOM elements can be given as a cell selector to select a cell in the DataTables API from that DOM element. This can be useful for getting data from a cell directly, or performing other cell based operations, when you have only the DOM node for reference, for example in an event handler.

###### Get the data for a cell that was clicked upon:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');

DataTable.dom.s('#example tbody').on('click', 'td', function () {
	let cellData = table.cell(this).data();
	// ... do something with `cellData`
});
```


## Function

< # Version requirement
<
< Using a function as a cell selector requires DataTables 1.10.3 or newer.

For complete control over which cells are selected, it is possible to provide a function with logic you've defined to perform the selection. That logic can be as simple or as complex as you wish, performing the selection by simply returning `true` if the cell should be included in the selected results and `false` if not.

That can be particularly useful for finding cells based on the data they contain, or based on properties of the cell node.

The function receives three parameters:

1. Cell index - see `-api cell().index()`
2. Cell data - see `-api cell().data()`. Note that this is the original data for the cell, not the rendered data if you are using `-init columns.render`
3. Cell node - see `-api cell().node()`. Note that this may be `null` if you are using `-init deferRender`.

The function is called once for every cell that can be selected, based on the `-type selector-modifier` options, which also defines the order of the cells for the called function.

###### Get the nodes for all cells that contain `1`:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');

let ones = table
	.cells((idx, data, node) => data == 1 ? true : false)
	.nodes();

// Add a class to the cells
ones.toDom().classAdd('highlight');
```


## Object

Similar to the `-type row-selector` and `-type column-selector`, `-type cell-selector` can also use indexes to select individual cells, but in this case an object is used which has `row` and `column` properties, each of which is set to the row and column index, respectively, for the cell to be selected.

Although not particularly useful as a primary selector method, this can be very useful for selecting individual cells based on a `-api cells()` call - see the example below.

###### Loop over all cells, adding a class if the data for the cell is greater than a given value.

```js
table.cells().every(function () {
	if (this.data() > 10) {
		this.node().classList.add('important');
	}
});
```


## jQuery

If you are using jQuery, DataTables supports passing a jQuery object to select cell, as jQuery is an _array-like_ list of DOM nodes. Any nodes which are selected by jQuery and match those available in the table's `dt-tag tbody` will be selected.

###### Get data from cells in a jQuery instance:

```js
let cells = $('td.immediate');
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');

let cellData = table.cells(cells).data();
```

## array

Any combination of the above options can be given as selector together, providing a method to select multiple cells, or to mix selector types, by simply providing the selector options you want in an array.

###### Get the data for two cells, based on id:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let data = table.cells(['#cell-1-42', '#cell-1-91']).data();
```

###### Mix `cell-selector` types - id and class selector

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let data = table.cells(['#cell-1-42', '.important']).data();
```
