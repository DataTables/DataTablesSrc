The DataTables `dt-api cells()` and `dt-api cell()` methods provide the ability to select individual cells from the table. What cells are selected and how the selector actually operates is controlled by this `dt-type cell-selector` data type.

### Options

The cell selector can be given in a number of different forms, to make it easy to apply to your data and use case:

* No selector - Select all cells
* `dt-type string` - jQuery selector
* `dt-type node` - `dt-tag td` / `dt-tag th` element selector
* `dt-type jQuery` - jQuery object of cell nodes
* `dt-type object` - DataTables cell indexes (`row` and `column` properties)
* `dt-type array` - Array containing any combination of the above options


## No selector

If no selector is given (more specifically `dt-type undefined`), then all cells are selected.

###### Get the nodes for all cells in the table:

```js
var table = $('#example').DataTable();
var cells = table.cells().nodes();
```


## string

When the selector is given as a string, it is treated as a [jQuery selector](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/) that operates on the `dt-tag td` and `dt-tag th` elements in the table's `dt-tag tbody`. For full information about the options available for jQuery selectors, please refer to the [jQuery selector documentation](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/).

Note that just like jQuery selector, is it possible to supply multiple selectors using comma separated notation (i.e. just separate by a comma) when the selector is provided as a string.

###### Get data from a single cell by id:

```js
var table = $('#example').DataTable();
var data = table.cell('#cell-2-42').data();
```

###### Select cells by class name:

```js
var table = $('#example').DataTable();
var cells = table.cells('.priority');
```

###### Select cells by two class name selectors:

```js
var table = $('#example').DataTable();
var cells = table.cells('.important, .intermediate');
```


## node

`dt-tag td` and `dt-tag th` DOM elements can be given as a cell selector to select a cell in the DataTabels API from that DOM element. This can be useful for getting data from a cell directly, or performing other cell based operations, when you have only the DOM node for reference, for example in an event handler.

###### Get the data for a cell that was clicked upon:

```js
var table = $('#example').DataTable();

$('#example tbody').on( 'click', 'td', function () {
  var cellData = table.cell( this ).data();
  // ... do something with `cellData`
} );
```


## jQuery

Very similar to the above `node` type (since a jQuery object is an _array-like_ list of DOM nodes), a jQuery instance can be given as a cell selector, with any nodes which are selected by jQuery and match those available in the table's `dt-tag tbody` selected.

###### Get data from cells in a jQuery instance:

```js
var cells = $('td.immediate');
var table = $('#example').DataTable();

var cellData = table.cells( cells ).data();


## Object

Similar to the `dt-type row-selector` and `dt-type column-selector`, `dt-type cell-selector` can also use indexes to select individual cells, but in this case an object is used which has `row` and `column` properties, each of which is set to the row and column index, respectively, for the cell to be selected.

Although not particularly useful as a primary selector method, this can be very useful for selecting individual cells based on a `dt-api cells()` call - see the example below.

###### Loop over all cells, adding a class if the data for the cell is greater than a given value.

```js
table.cells().eq(0).each( function ( cellIdx, i ) {
	var cell = table.cell( cellIdx );

	if ( cell.data() > 10 ) {
		$(cell.node()).addClass( 'important' );
	}
} );
```


## array

Any combination of the above options can be given as selector together, providing a method to select multiple cells, or to mix selector types, by simply providing the selector options you want in an array.

###### Get the data for two cells, based on id:

```js
var table = $('#example').DataTable();
var data = table.cells( ['#cell-1-42', '#cell-1-91'] ).data();
```

###### Mix `cell-selector` types - id and class selector

```js
var table = $('#example').DataTable();
var data = table.cells( ['#cell-1-42', '.important'] ).data();
```
