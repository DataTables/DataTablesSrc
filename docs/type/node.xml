When working with the DOM, as is typical in a web-browser using Javascript(!), you will often assign DOM elements to a variable - we define this as a `node` for ease of reference. For example:

```js
var node = document.getElementById('example');
```

Or with jQuery:

```js
var node = $('#example').get(0);
```

Technically this is an `dt-type object` primitive, but defining such objects as a `node` allows the documentation to be much more succinct.


## Use in DataTables

Where a parameter is shown as accepting a node type, or a method returning a node type, it indicates that an object is expect / returned which refers to a DOM element.

Note that `node` refers to the native DOM element, not a jQuery object containing the element. Many DataTables methods will accept both a `node` and a `dt-type jQuery` instance, but this isn't always the case, particularly when considering returned values.
