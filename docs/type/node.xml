When working with the DOM, as is typical in a web-browser using JavaScript(!), you will often assign DOM elements to a variable - we define this as a `node` for ease of reference. For example:

```js
var node = document.getElementById('example');
```

Technically this is an `dt-type object` primitive, but defining such objects as a `node` allows the documentation to be much more succinct.


## Use in DataTables

Where a parameter is shown as accepting a node type, or a method returning a node type, it indicates that an object is expect / returned which refers to a DOM element.
