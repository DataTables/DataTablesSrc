Javascript doesn't have a native integer data type as `Numbers` can represent integers without compromising data accuracy. However, it is often useful to indicate for a particular parameter or method that it expects or returns a value that is an integer, rather than a floating point number (which are also represented by the `Number` type). As such, we define this special, non-native, type to indicate the use of an integer value.

A detailed description of the `Number` type is available on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number).


## Use in DataTables

Where a parameter is shown as accepting an integer type, or a method returning an integer type, it indicates that a `Number` with an integer value is expected / returned. Passing in a floating point number will result in undefined behaviour.
