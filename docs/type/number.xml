	<![CDATA[

Numbers in JavaScript (both integers and floating point numbers) are stored in the `number` type.

A detailed description of the `Number` type is available on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number).


## Use in DataTables

Where a parameter is shown as accepting a number type, or a method returning a number type, it indicates that a numeric value is accepted / returned. We define a special type of `dt-type integer` as a sub-set of `number`s which accept only integer values. As such `number` types can be either integers or floating point numbers.
