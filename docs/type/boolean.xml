	<![CDATA[

Javascript has the boolean values `true` and `false` values built in as primitives. These are used to indicate a boolean state for a variable / condition.

A detailed description of the `Boolean` type is available on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean).


## Use in DataTables

Where a parameter is shown as accepting a boolean type, or a method returning a boolean type, it indicates that a boolean value is accepted / returned.
