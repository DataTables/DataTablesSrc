The DataTables `-api rows()` and `-api row()` (also optionally `-api cells()` and `-api cell()`) methods provide the ability to select rows from the table. What rows are selected and how the selector actually operates is controlled by this `-type row-selector` data type.

### Options

The row selector can be given in a number of different forms, to make it easy to apply to your data and use case:

* No selector - Select all rows
* `-type integer` - Row index selector
* `dt-string *` - All rows selector (wildcard)
* `dt-string #{string}` - ID selector
* `dt-string :eq()` - Index selector
* `-type string` - CSS selector
* `-type node` - This may be one of the following:
  * `-tag tr` - table row element
  * `-tag td` - table cell element (<span class="since">Since: 1.10.11</span>)
  * Any element which has a `data-dt-row` attribute assigned to it, or a parent (<span class="since">Since: 1.10.11</span>). This can be used by extensions such as FixedColumns and Responsive to allow easy row selection.
* `-type function` - Function selector (<span class="since">Since: 1.10.3</span>)
* `-type jQuery` - jQuery object of row nodes
* `-type array` - Array containing any combination of the above options


## No selector

If no selector is given (more specifically `-type undefined`), then all rows are selected.

###### Get data for all rows in the table:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let allData = table.rows().data();
```


## integer

DataTables stores each row internally with a row index for fast look up of row information. When the selector is given as an integer, this value represents a row index (`-api rows().indexes()` / `-api row().index()`).

###### Row index 0 data:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let data = table.row(0).data();
```

###### Find data using row indexes:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');

// Find indexes of rows which have `Yes` in the second column
let indexes = table
	.rows()
	.eq(0)
	.filter(function (rowIdx) {
		return table.cell(rowIdx, 1).data() === 'Yes' ? true : false;
	});

// Add a class to those rows using an index selector
table
	.rows(indexes)
	.nodes()
	.toDom()
	.classAdd('highlight');
```


## string - *

To select all rows you can either simply not give a selector (as described above) or you can use a string with a single `*` character in it. This can be particularly useful when using a `-type row-selector` with `-api cells()`.

###### Get data for all rows in the table:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let allData = table.rows('*').data();
```


## string - #ID

DataTables row selector is optimised for IDs as it is natural to wish to select rows by unique information. This is distinct from a CSS selector as DataTables can optimise this selector type so as to not involve the DOM - also allowing an id row selector to operate on rows which have not yet had their DOM nodes created (when using `-init deferRender` for extra speed).

With dynamically sourced data, the id assigned to the row is identifier using the `-init rowId` option. The data used as the id can be of any value, although it must be unique in the table.

To use an id selector, simply prefix the id value for the row you wish to select with a number sign: `#`. The value that follows is taken as the id. Unlike CSS this value does __not__ need to be escaped - although this means that an id selector must be used alone (e.g. a class name cannot also be used), it does make is much easier to use for complex data.

###### Select a single row by id:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let row = table.row('#row-42');
```

###### Select multiple rows by id:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let rows = table.rows(['#row-42', '#row-51']);
```


## string - :eq()

It can sometimes be useful to select a row by its position in the data set, which can be different from the data index that is used when the row selector is an integer. This selector provides that ability.


###### Select the first row in the table

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let row = table.row(':eq(0)');
```


## string

When the selector is given as a string, it is treated as a [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Selectors) that operates on the `-tag tr` elements in the table.

Note that just like CSS selector, is it possible to supply multiple selectors using comma separated notation (i.e. just separate by a comma) when the selector is provided as a string.

###### Select rows by class name:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let rows = table.rows('.priority');
```

###### Select rows by two class name selectors:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let rows = table.rows('.important, .intermediate');
```


## node

`dt-tag tr` DOM elements can be given as a row selector to select a row in the DataTables API from that DOM element. This can be useful for getting data from a row, or performing other row based operations, when you have only the DOM node for reference, for example in an event handler.

###### Get the data for a row that was clicked upon:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');

DataTable.Dom.s('#example tbody').on('click', 'tr', function () {
	let rowData = table.row(this).data();
	// ... do something with `rowData`
});
```


## Function

< # Version requirement
<
< Using a function as a row selector requires DataTables 1.10.3 or newer.

For complete control over which rows are selected, it is possible to provide a function with logic you've defined to perform the selection. That logic can be as simple or as complex as you wish, performing the selection by simply returning `true` if the row should be included in the selected results and `false` if not.

That can be particularly useful for finding rows based on the data contained in the rows, or based on properties of the nodes.

The function receives three parameters:

1. Row index - see `-api row().index()`
2. Row data - see `-api row().data()`. Note that this is the original data object for the row, not the rendered data if you are using `-init columns.render`
3. Row node - see `-api row().node()`. Note that this may be `null` if you are using `-init deferRender`.

The function is called once for every row that can be selected, based on the `-type selector-modifier` options, which also defines the order of the rows for the called function.

###### Get the data for all rows that have a `first_name` starting with `A`:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');

let names = table
	.rows((idx, data, node) => data.first_name.charAt(0) === 'A')
	.data();
```


## jQuery

If you are using jQuery, then very similar to the above `node` type (since a jQuery object is an _array-like_ list of DOM nodes), a jQuery instance can be given as a row selector, with any nodes which are selected by jQuery and match those available in the table selected.

###### Get data from rows in a jQuery instance:

```js
let rows = $('tr.immediate');
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');

let rowData = table.rows(rows).data();
```

###### Use jQuery selectors to get the data in the fifth row of the table:

```js
let rowData1 = table.rows(':nth-child(5)').data();
let rowData2 = table.rows(':eq(4)').data();
```

## array

Any combination of the above options can be given as selector together, providing a method to select multiple rows, or to mix selector types, by simply providing the selector options you want in an array.

###### Get the data for two rows, based on id:

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let data = table.rows(['#row-42', '#row-91']).data();
```

###### Mix `row-selector` types - id and class selector

```js
let table = new DataTable('#myTable');
let data = table.rows(['#row-42', '.important']).data();
```
