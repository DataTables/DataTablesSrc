JavaScript has the `null` type built-in as a literal value, and is often used to represent the absence of data. `null` and `dt-type undefined` are similar in this regard, but null typically shows that a value has been assigned, even if it is empty.

A detailed description of `null` is available on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null).


## Use in DataTables

Where a parameter is shown as accepting a `null` value, or a method returning a `null` value, it indicates that a literal `null` is expected / returned (not to be confused with `dt-type undefined` or `false` which are different values).
