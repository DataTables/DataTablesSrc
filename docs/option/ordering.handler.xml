	<description>
		When ordering is enabled for a DataTable you need a way for the end user to activate ordering on a column's data. This option controls the built in handler for that in DataTables. If enabled a listener is added to header cells (both click and for accessability the enter key) that will trigger ordering on a column.

		It can be useful to disable this ability if you wish to use an extension such as [ColumnControl](https://datatables.net/extensions/columncontrol) to control column ordering.

		If this option is disabled, the header cells for the table do not show a `pointer` cursor when hovered over (the classes `dt-orderable-desc` and `dt-orderable-asc` are removed).

		It is worth highlighting that this option interacts with `-init columns.orderable`: if disabled, the listener is not added.
