	<description>
		When ordering is enabled in a DataTable you will typically want a visual indication of the applied ordering shown to the end user - this option controls that indicator in the table header cells. When enabled, the header cells will have a `-tag span` added to them (with the class `dt-column-order`) added to them to show the ordering status of a column.

		It can be useful to disable this ability if you wish to use an extension such as [ColumnControl](https://datatables.net/extensions/columncontrol) to control and indicate column ordering.

		It is worth highlighting that this option interacts with `-init columns.orderable`: if disabled, the indicator will not be shown.
