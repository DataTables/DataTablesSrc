	<description>
		All strings that DataTables uses in its user interface are defined in this object, allowing you to modified them individually or completely replace them all as required. This ensures that DataTables is fully internationalisable as strings for any language can be used.

		The default language options for DataTables are shown below for reference. Additionally there are a wide range of translations readily available on this site, in the [internationalisation plug-ins](//datatables.net/plug-ins/i18n).

		The following is the default object that DataTables uses for its language strings (for information about each individual parameter, please see its individual documentation document):

		```js
		{
		    "decimal":        "",
		    "emptyTable":     "No data available in table",
		    "info":           "Showing _START_ to _END_ of _TOTAL_ entries",
		    "infoEmpty":      "Showing 0 to 0 of 0 entries",
		    "infoFiltered":   "(filtered from _MAX_ total entries)",
		    "infoPostFix":    "",
		    "thousands":      ",",
		    "lengthMenu":     "Show _MENU_ entries",
		    "loadingRecords": "Loading...",
		    "processing":     "",
		    "search":         "Search:",
		    "zeroRecords":    "No matching records found",
		    "paginate": {
		        "first":      "First",
		        "last":       "Last",
		        "next":       "Next",
		        "previous":   "Previous"
		    },
		    "aria": {
		        "orderable":  "Order by this column",
		        "orderableReverse": "Reverse order this column"
		    }
		}
		```

		As of DataTables 1.10.7 the new `-api i18n()` method can be used by plug-in authors to access language information from the `-init language` object. As such the list of parameters available here is not exhaustive - please refer to the documentation for the plug-in if it makes use of the `-api i18n()` method for full information about the parameters it can use.
