		Please note that this option has been deprecated in favour of `-feature paging.numbers`, `-feature paging.firstLast` and `-feature paging.previousNext` to improve compartmentalisation of the features in DataTables. It will be removed in DataTables 3 and it is recommended no longer to use this feature in preparation for that change.

    <![CDATA[
    This option sets the paging type for all `-feature paging` table feature controls used for a table. The values it can take are defined in `-feature paging.type`, which be used to override this option (as of DataTables 2).
    
    Please note that the default value of this parameter was changed in DataTables 2. It is now `full_numbers`, while in DataTables 1.x it was `simple_numbers`. This change was made as the paging control in DataTables 2 is now responsive and also uses icons for the fixed buttons.
