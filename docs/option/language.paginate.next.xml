		Text to use for the 'next' pagination button (to take the user to the next page).
		
		Note that DataTables writes this property to the document as HTML, so you can use HTML tags in the language string, but HTML entities such as `<` and `>` should be encoded as `&lt;` and `&gt;` respectively.

    	Please note that the default value of this parameter was changed in DataTables 2. It is now `›`, while in DataTables 1.x it was `Next`.
