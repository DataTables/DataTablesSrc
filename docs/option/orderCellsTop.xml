		As of DataTables 2 the default option for this parameter has changed to `null` rather than the previous `false` in 1.x. The result is that all cells in the header will have a sort listener attached and icons shown. You can set this value to `false` to have the same behaviour as v1.x.

		This property is not very flexible, being able to specify the top or bottom rows only. In DataTables 2 is it superseded by the `data-dt-order` attribute for the `-tag tr` and / or `-tag th` elements in the `-tag thead` of the table. See `-init columns.orderable` for further details.

		Allows control over whether DataTables should use the top (`true`) unique cell that is found for a single column, or the bottom (`false`) to attach the default order listener and display sorting icons. This can be useful when using complex headers.

		As of DataTables 2, if the value of this parameter is given as `null` (which it is by default) all cells in the header will automatically have the sort listener attached and icons shown.

		Consider for example the following HTML header:

		```html
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<td rowspan="2">1</td>
					<td>2.1</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2.2</td>
				</tr>
			</thead>
		```

		In this case, when `dt-init orderCellsTop` is `false` the cells `-string 1` and `-string 2.2` will have the order event listener applied to them. If `dt-init orderCellsTop` is `true` then `-string 1` and `-string 2.1` will have the order event listeners applied to them. Finally, if the value is given is `null` (default), all cells will have the ordering event listeners attached.
