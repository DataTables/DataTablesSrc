		Regular expressions can be used to build fantastically complex filtering terms, but also it is perfectly valid for users to enter characters such as `string *` into the filter, so a decision needs to be made if you wish to escape regular expression special characters or not. This option controls that ability in DataTables.

		It is simply a flag to indicate if the search term should be interpreted as a regular expression (`true`) or not (`false`) and therefore and special regex characters escaped.
