	<summary>Add event listeners to the DataTable during initialisation.</summary>
	<since>2.3</since>

	<type type="object">
		The object is a list of events to listen for where the property name is the [event name](/reference/event) to listen for and the value is the event handler, or an array of event handlers.
	</type>

	<default>null</default>

	<description>
		DataTables has an [extensive collection of events](/reference/event) that you can listen for using the `-api on()` method. It can also be useful to listen for events that occur during the DataTable's initialisation so you can take actions as needed (e.g. using `-event preXhr` to know when an Ajax request is made). This property provides that ability.

		Any event name that is given in the list of events can be used as the object property name, while the value may take a callback function as the event handler, or an array of functions if you wish to listen with more than one event handler.

		The arguments passed to the event handlers are identical to those for the event identified by the property name.
