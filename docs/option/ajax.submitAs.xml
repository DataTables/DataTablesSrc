		When making an Ajax request, there are times which you might wish to submit the data to the server as a JSON string. This is particularly useful in .NET which can easily parse the JSON for you, or in cases with values such as `null` are important. This option provides that ability.

		Typically this option will be used with a POST request where the data is submitted as part of the request body, but if used with GET requests, the JSON string will be used as the query string on the URL.

		As of DataTables 2.3.6, when set to `json`, the ContentType header for the request will automatically be set to be `application/json; charset=utf-8`, unless a value has already been specified.

		Backwards compatibility note: This option was introduced in DataTables 2.3, replacing the ability of `-init ajax.data` used as a function returning a string. This is an important change as it allows extensions and any other listeners for `-event preXhr` to be able to work with object based data, while still providing the ability to send a JSON string to the server. This option is highly recommended over a string return from `-init ajax.data`.
