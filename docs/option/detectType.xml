		DataTables will attempt to automatically determine what data type exists in your table's columns. There is extensive documentation [about this available in the manual](https://datatables.net/manual/data/types) so for brevity it won't be repeated here. However, this option provides the ability to disable the auto type detection that DataTables performs.

		This might be useful if you are using server-side processing where data can change between pages and the client-side is unable to automatically reliably determine a column's data type. Note that you could also specify `-init columns.type` which will stop the automatic type detection from running for a column as well.
