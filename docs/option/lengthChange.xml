		When pagination is enabled, this option will control the display of the `-feature pageLength` table control feature, giving the end user to change the number of records to be shown per page.

		As of DataTables 2, the position of the information display is defined by the `-init layout` option, which can also be used to disabled the feature or provide extra configuration for it.

		In legacy 1.x installs, the `-init dom` option can be used to position the element along with some CSS.

		If this option is disabled (`false`) the length change input control is removed - although the `dt-api page.len()` method can still be used if you wish to programmatically change the page size and `dt-init pageLength` can be used to specify the initial page length. Paging itself is not affected.

		Additionally, if pagination is disabled using the `dt-init paging` option, this option is automatically disabled since it has no relevance when there is no pagination.
