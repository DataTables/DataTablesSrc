	 * use through the `dom` initialisation option.
	 * 
	 * Each feature plug-in is described by an object which must have the
	 * following properties:
	 * 
	 * * `fnInit` - function that is used to initialise the plug-in,
	 * * `cFeature` - a character so the feature can be enabled by the `dom`
	 *   instillation option. This is case sensitive.
	 *
	 * The `fnInit` function has the following input parameters:
	 *
	 * 1. `{object}` DataTables settings object: see
	 *    {@link DataTable.models.oSettings}
	 *
	 * And the following return is expected:
	 * 
	 * * {node|null} The element which contains your feature. Note that the
	 *   return may also be void if your plug-in does not require to inject any
	 *   DOM elements into DataTables control (`dom`) - for example this might
	 *   be useful when developing a plug-in which allows table control via

	/**
	 * Row searching.
	 * 
	 * This method of searching is complimentary to the default type based

	 * over the searching logic. Each element in this array is a function
	 * (parameters described below) that is called for every row in the table,
	 * and your logic decides if it should be included in the searching data set
	 * or not.
	 *
	 * Searching functions have the following input parameters:
	 *
	 * 1. `{object}` DataTables settings object: see
	 *    {@link DataTable.models.oSettings}
	 * 2. `{array|object}` Data for the row to be processed (same as the
	 *    original format that was passed in as the data source, or an array
	 *    from a DOM data source
	 * 3. `{int}` Row index ({@link DataTable.models.oSettings.aoData}), which
	 *    can be useful to retrieve the `TR` element if you need DOM interaction.
	 *
	 * And the following return is expected:
	 *
	 * * {boolean} Include the row in the searched result set (true) or not
	 *   (false)
	 *
	 * Note that as with the main search ability in DataTables, technically this
	 * is "filtering", since it is subtractive. However, for consistency in

	/**
	 * Ordering plug-ins - custom data source
	 * 
	 * The extension options for ordering of data available here is complimentary

	 * allows much greater control over the the data that is being used to
	 * order a column, but is necessarily therefore more complex.
	 * 
	 * This type of ordering is useful if you want to do ordering based on data
	 * live from the DOM (for example the contents of an 'input' element) rather
	 * than just the static string that DataTables knows of.
	 * 
	 * The way these plug-ins work is that you create an array of the values you
	 * wish to be ordering for the column in question and then return that
	 * array. The data in the array much be in the index order of the rows in
	 * the table (not the currently ordering order!). Which order data gathering
	 * function is run here depends on the `dt-init columns.orderDataType`
	 * parameter that is used for the column (if any).
	 *
	 * The functions defined take two parameters:
	 *
	 * 1. `{object}` DataTables settings object: see
	 *    {@link DataTable.models.oSettings}
	 * 2. `{int}` Target column index
	 *
	 * Each function is expected to return an array:

	     *  1. `{*}` Data from the column cell to be prepared for ordering
		 *
		 * And return:

		 * * `{*}` Data to be sorted upon
		 *
		 * `{type}-asc` and `{type}-desc`: Functions are typical Javascript sort
