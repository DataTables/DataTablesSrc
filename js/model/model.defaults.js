 * Developer note: The properties of the object below are given in Hungarian
 * notation, that was used as the interface for DataTables prior to v1.10, however
 * from v1.10 onwards the primary interface is camel case. In order to avoid
 * breaking backwards compatibility utterly with this change, the Hungarian
 * version is still, internally the primary interface, but is is not documented
 * - hence the @name tags in each doc comment. This allows a Javascript function
 * to create a map from Hungarian notation to camel case (going the other direction
 * would require each property to be listed, which would add around 3K to the size
 * of DataTables, while this method is about a 0.5K hit).
 *
 * Ultimately this does pave the way for Hungarian notation to be dropped
 * completely, but that is a massive amount of work and will break current
 * installs (therefore is on-hold until v2).

	/**
	 * DataTables can be instructed to load data to display in the table from a
	 * Ajax source. This option defines how that Ajax call is made and where to.
	 *
	 * The `ajax` property has three different modes of operation, depending on
	 * how it is defined. These are:
	 *
	 * * `string` - Set the URL from where the data should be loaded from.
	 * * `object` - Define properties for `jQuery.ajax`.
	 * * `function` - Custom data get function
	 *
	 * `string`
	 * --------
	 *
	 * As a string, the `ajax` property simply defines the URL from which
	 * DataTables will load data.
	 *
	 * `object`
	 * --------
	 *
	 * As an object, the parameters in the object are passed to
	 * [jQuery.ajax](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) allowing fine control
	 * of the Ajax request. DataTables has a number of default parameters which
	 * you can override using this option. Please refer to the jQuery
	 * documentation for a full description of the options available, although
	 * the following parameters provide additional options in DataTables or
	 * require special consideration:
	 *
	 * * `data` - As with jQuery, `data` can be provided as an object, but it
	 *   can also be used as a function to manipulate the data DataTables sends
	 *   to the server. The function takes a single parameter, an object of
	 *   parameters with the values that DataTables has readied for sending. An
	 *   object may be returned which will be merged into the DataTables
	 *   defaults, or you can add the items to the object that was passed in and
	 *   not return anything from the function. This supersedes `fnServerParams`
	 *   from DataTables 1.9-.
	 *
	 * * `dataSrc` - By default DataTables will look for the property `data` (or
	 *   `aaData` for compatibility with DataTables 1.9-) when obtaining data
	 *   from an Ajax source or for server-side processing - this parameter
	 *   allows that property to be changed. You can use Javascript dotted
	 *   object notation to get a data source for multiple levels of nesting, or
	 *   it my be used as a function. As a function it takes a single parameter,
	 *   the JSON returned from the server, which can be manipulated as
	 *   required, with the returned value being that used by DataTables as the
	 *   data source for the table.
	 *
	 * * `success` - Should not be overridden it is used internally in
	 *   DataTables. To manipulate / transform the data returned by the server
	 *   use `ajax.dataSrc`, or use `ajax` as a function (see below).
	 *
	 * `function`
	 * ----------
	 *
	 * As a function, making the Ajax call is left up to yourself allowing
	 * complete control of the Ajax request. Indeed, if desired, a method other
	 * than Ajax could be used to obtain the required data, such as Web storage
	 * or an AIR database.
	 *
	 * The function is given four parameters and no return is required. The
	 * parameters are:
	 *
	 * 1. _object_ - Data to send to the server
	 * 2. _function_ - Callback function that must be executed when the required
	 *    data has been obtained. That data should be passed into the callback
	 *    as the only parameter
	 * 3. _object_ - DataTables settings object for the table
